                    <small> May 29th, 2021</small>
                    <p> It was our first date and I was so so nervous. 
                    You came to pick me up and funny enough, 
                    my dad was there with Sophie bidding me goodbye for the night. I remember sitting in your car and 
                    immediately getting a feeling of warmth around me. I felt like I had known you for centuries. We talked as we got to the movies and sat down in our seats. 
                    We were talking about our colleges and how we are so anxious for them to start. We watched through Spiral and when I closed my eyes, you were there to comfort me. 
                    As we finished up, we went back to the car and cuddled for a bit. Then you kissed me!!! I was in absolute shock because I had never kissed anyone before. 
                    I was so anxious because I thought I was going to fuck it up but no. 
                    You made me comfortable in my own skin and that will be something I will remember for the rest of my life. 
                    Finally, we had Chick-Fil-A and I had felt comfortable talking about my past. Right there, you made me feel a type of way that I have never felt before. </p>

                    <p> The week school starts I was afraid we were going to drift apart. 
                        This fear came from the fact that I thought you were going to find 
                        someone that is better than me. But I never realized that we were just 
                        getting started on our relationship. We talked and talked more and more 
                        and I started to treat you like my girlfriend, checking up on you 
                        and making sure you got home okay.

                    <small> Oct 2021 - Nov 2021</small>
                    <p> From these dates, I started getting ready to ask you to be my girlfriend. 
                        In early November, I had gotten into an accident and you know what my first thought was? It was to call you. 
                        I had to urge to cry so hard because I had messed up, but you made me feel like I was not alone and that it was okay. 
                        After that, I had realized that I wanted you so bad that I was willing to call YOU first before anyone else when I got into that situation.
                        From that point onwards, I started planning on how to ask you to be my girlfriend.

                    <h2> The Day!!</h2>
                    <small> Jan 2nd, 2022</small>
                    <p> The big day, that I have been planning for two months has come. I am about to ask you to be my girlfriend. But lets rewind. For the past two months
                        I've had people ask me when I am going to ask you and even you had asked "Pranay what are we?". I stumbled over my words because I didn't want to say
                        "We are friends" but I also didn't want to say "We are dating". So I started telling you that I have been planning to ask you and that was one of the best things I've ever done. 
                        It had taken me TWO months to prepare myself to ask you. And so I did and it was the best decision I have ever made in my life. You said yes, and from Jan 2nd, 2022, we had become boyfriend and girlfriend.
                    </p>

                    <small> July 2nd, 2022</small>
                    <p> Oh my, our 6 months came so quick. In the beginning of our relationship, you know it was really rough, but I am not going to go into details. 
                        But it shaped our relationship into a healthy one. Where we both talk about our issues and we see where we can improve. 
                        And that helped a lot. As for our 6 months, we planned out a beautiful picnic and sat in Doylestown and painted on our canvases. 
                        Truly, that one was one of my favorites. </p>

                    <p> 1 YEAAARRRRR. 1 year is so crazy to me. 
                        That year, you were in India so we weren't able to do anything but it showed
                         that no matter how far the distance is and how busy each of us are, 
                         our love will never be hindered. </p>

                        <p> 1.5 years. Our 1.5 years, we decided to make up for our 1 year and do something special. 
                            I know i wanted to do create something special for you. I made a photo bouquet and got you an SOS poster 
                            because you were so obsessed with SZA's SOS, it was definitely one of my favorite gifts I have given you. </p>

                        <p> Holy shit, it has been two years since we started our relationship.
                             The ups and downs we have gone through have been life changing. This year, we were not able to celebrate properly because I was in India
                            but I decided to make something for you which I hope you will love. 
                            This website is always going to be a a sign that our love is meant to be and that my forever is you. 
                            I love you so much, and I hope you enjoyed this.

        </h2>

        <p class="endingPara">
            Thank you so much for the last 2 years. Making sure you feel loved and cherished is all I've ever wanted. You, Pranjal Patel, have 
            changed my life for the better and I can never repay you. The amount of love and careness I feel whenever I am with you
            can never amount to anything I have ever felt in my life. You are the epitome of the perfect girlfriend and I hope you know
            that you deserve all the the best things in the world because you do deserve them. I know the situation we are in is not ideal but 
            I hope this makes up for a little bit of it. I want you to know I will give you the world soon enough. I love you!!!
